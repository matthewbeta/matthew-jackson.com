I largely missed/avoided needing to build any single page applications. I didn’t reframe my entire perspective on websites to JavaScript first. It feels like the pendulum swung as far that way as it could and has now swung back. Server rendering is important again. Now it’s called rendering on “the edge”. It sounds cool. 

It’s nice that things move and evolve. Change is inevitable. I’m not sure much of what I built in the last 5 years would have been better as a single page app though. I’m not sure much of what I’m building now would be better rendered on the edge. I am pretty sure that sending HTML down the wire, making it look good with CSS and making it do stuff with JS is the past, present and future. 

If you stand still long enough everyone catches up eventually.
