I've been following Eric Meyer's posts about the terrible tragedy thats unfolded for his family over the last year.

Its made me think about my own young daughter and made me try not to think about how to deal with something terrible like this. Its made me think about the sister who I never knew and how my parents dealt with it. I pray I never have to.

Today I made my site purple (it is my and my daughter's favourite colour too) for Rebecca, for my sister Laura, for all the families who go through the worst thing I can possibly imagine, and for me because however pithy it felt good to do something.
