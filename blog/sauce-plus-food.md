I recently tried Curry WÃ¼rst (or tomato sauce with a side of frankfurter and chips). It was disgusting, but got me thinking about sauces. 

This is an unordered list of the best sauce-plus-food combinations. Don't @ me.

* **Salad Cream with Lasagne.** I promise. This is the _best_ sauce/food combination. 
* **Barbecue Sauce with Fried or Scrambled Eggs.** This is the only sauce you should have with eggs. Except...
* **Chilli Sauce with Eggs (any way).** Especially Encona Hot Pepper Sauce, Sriracha or Sweet Chilli. Also with Avocado. The chilli sauce should be hot.
* **Worcestershire Sauce with Cheese and Beans on toast** This is my comfort food.

P.S. Also, Bacon should be eaten with Brown Sauce. Not tomato.
