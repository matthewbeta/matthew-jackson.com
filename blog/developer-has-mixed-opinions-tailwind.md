Excuse the title. I can't tell you how nice it is to read a balanced post about _anything_ on the internet 👏.

If you think a technology generating as much traction and controversy as Tailwind is either good or bad, you are being a bit silly. I would much rather read a nuanced opinion and understand what the grey areas are.
