This post resonated with me. Some great points, like designing for one person. I especially love the  “Add nonsense” principle.

> So in order to break out of the antiquated idea that designing for accessibility is a form of charity, I always use the principle that you need to add nonsense to the design process as well.

More nonsense please.

It also got me thinking about people who experience the web in a different way to me and how we could bring that nonsense and whimsy to them. 

I’ve often thought about how we could create experiences that were not just equal, but different. A user experience that is great for screen readers, with its own unique characteristics and capacity for surprise and delight. For example a unique experience for users of screen readers using the [CSS Speech module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-speech-1/#voice-char-props) maybe. 

I guess first we need to make sure the things we build are baseline functional. However it feels like a whole world to be explored.
