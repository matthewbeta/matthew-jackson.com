<p class="lede">Of course we all know Facebook is the fount of all evil, but this week I saw a post from a friend, which was sort of a chain letter that didn't make me want to pick out my eyes with rocks. It was a call to occupy Facebook with art</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The post was a picture of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_and_Dinos_Chapman">Jake and Dinos Chapman's</a> <a href="http://jakeanddinoschapman.com/works/the-sum-of-all-evil/">The Sum of alll Evil</a>. The piece is as awesome as it is horrific, so I clicked like (as is the parlance) and commented my approval. However, my comment was then replied to, informing me I had been given Frida Kahlo. </p>

## Wat?

Re-reading the initial post explained that by liking it, I consented to taking part in a sort of cultural sit-in. Not being a huge fan of Kahlo, I'm not very familiar with her work. She's the self-portrait lady, yeah?

I did some google research and found out a bit about her style and why she painted what she did. Started reading a bit of bio and before I knew what was going on I was learning about something. Something that wasn't javascript or CSS level 4 selectors and it was interesting, damnit. 

I eventually settled on this:

<figure>
<img src="/assets/images/weeping-coconuts-1951.jpg">
<figcaption>Weeping Coconuts (Cocos gimientes) by <em>Frida Kahlo</em> (1951)</figcaption>	
</figure>

I chose this because it's supposed to be very sad; As Kahlo got older she turned away from self-portraits and started painting still life. This was possibly due to the affect of prescription medication had on her ability to paint with the detail she'd used to [^1]. Kahlo thought they would sell quicker and she and her husband, Diego Rivera, needed money to pay her medical bills [^2]. However, despite this tragic tale, nothing about the actual image seems sad to me. In fact, a crying coconut seems absurdly funny.

It was painted as a gift to a friend, Elena Boder. Boder didn't like it and returned it, expecting Kahlo to offer her another one. She didn't. She just painted over the "For Elena Boder" bit and sold it [^3]. Hence the message on the finished piece saying "Painted with great affection. Frida Kahlo"

Clearly an excellent sense of humour.
