Certainly late to the party, but I highly recommend this book - [This is Going to Hurt by Adam Kay](http://www.thisisgoingtohurt.co.uk). Kay has turned his diary entries into a fantastic book, chronicling his 6(ish) years as a Junior Doctor. 

It made me laugh, cry, and wince. Beautiful, poignant, and important. 

It is [being made into a comedy series for BBC](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt8681148/?ref_=m_nm_knf_t1). I hope they can do it some justice. If they can make it a quarter as affecting as the book, it will be powerful indeed.
