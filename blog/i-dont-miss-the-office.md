I love this essay by Paul Ford. I just don't love *going* to work. This quote is absolutely me:

> And I find that the people who don’t want to go back to pre-pandemic office culture are the people who are the most concerned about their time. Sometimes this is their personality; they are engineers who look at travel as a waste, who seek efficiencies in their work and health. Sometimes they’re people with other stress, like parents of young children who triangulate between the day care’s schedule, their boss’s expectations, and kids’ needs...

The idea of sitting in my car for 2 hours to get to another room and do the same thing I can do at home feels like madness.

I love my job, I love the people I work with. I also love working from home.
