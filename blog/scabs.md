You could make the argument that the outpouring of emotion and vitriol about the announcement yesterday is misplaced or disproportionate. Given everything that is wrong in the world, sport doesn't matter.

But that is to say a shared history, relationships, culture, don't matter. I've supported Chelsea for nearly 30 years. Those 3 decades are like a long relationship. Memories, friendships, family connections, some to people who are no longer alive. All in the bin because some very rich men want to have more money.

It is obvious that fans mean little to big clubs. Supporters only recourse is to vote with their feet and boycott games. Assuming all fans refused to return (unlikely due to the tourists and corporate seats) why would the clubs care? In 2018/19, the last season Chelsea played a full campaign in front of supporters, their match day revenue was [75 million euros](https://www.statista.com/statistics/251147/revenue-of-fc-chelsea-london-by-stream/). Reportedly every club involved in the super league will be given 3 billion euros by an investment bank. Why would a largely faceless corporation give a fuck about losing supporters?

I'm currently angry, and disappointed, and sad, but cynically, not that surprised. I'm not sure what will happen when the dust settles on all of this, but the genie is very much out of the bottle.
