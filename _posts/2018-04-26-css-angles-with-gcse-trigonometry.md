At work last week, we started building a cool new project and part of the design revolves around angles. A particularly tricky part is angular-cropped images. The images need to have a 8 degree angle top and bottom to give a skewed look‚Äìhowever the image cannot be distorted.

Here's an example of what we want:

![Bill Murray, but with the top and bottom of the photo with wedges sliced out]({{ "/assets/angle-example.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Some other points worth mentioning are that the images can be any size and in any width container.

After quickly abandoning my initial attempt with transform skew, I reached for the [`clip-path` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path). Clip path accepts a polygon value, which you can create with some 4 lots of 2 percentage coordinates. I like to use a web app called [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) to quickly test out polygons so I knocked up a quick example:

![Screen grab of Clippy web app showign a rough angled masked image]({{ "/assets/clippy-test.png" | absolute_url }})

This uses the follwing CSS which kind of makes sense but it actually doesn't work.

````CSS
clip-path: polygon(0 8%, 100% 0%, 100% 92%, 0% 100%);
````

The issue is, if the image proprtions change, the angle is going to change. Basically we need to work out the sides of a triangle when we only know 2 angles. Like this:

![Photo showing the unknown values and known 8¬∞ angle of the triangle slice we need to 'clip' from our image']({{ "/assets/angle-problem.jpg" | absolute_url }})

One thing we can know though, is the aspect ratio of the image. For example the image we've been using is *16:9*. Therefore we could add those measurements in and see if it helps us. As the clip-path will be in percent, we can scale it all up after.

![Photo showing the 16 x value, 9 y value and known 8¬∞ angle of the triangle slice we need to 'clip' from our image']({{ "/assets/angle-closer.jpg" | absolute_url }})

Now we have a triangle where we know 1 side (16 width) and one angle (8¬∞). Digging out my old maths textbooks, I can confirm that we need to use some GCSE trigonometry. To be specific, the phrase [`SOH CAH TOA`](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/sohcahtoa.html).

Effectively, this is mnemonic to remember the 3 ways of working out the sides of a triangle, based on the information you have. We have the *Opposite* angle (8¬∞) or *O*, the *Adjacent* side (16 wide) or *A*. O and A means we need to use *T* (Tan). Using the formula `Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent` (TOA). Algebra time...

![Photo showing the formula Tangent = Opposite / Adjacent with values applied and then the equasion being simplified to its result revealing the 3rd missing side of the triangle as 2.248653355238256]({{ "/assets/algebra.png" | absolute_url }})

That shows the other unknown side of our triangle is 2.248653355238256 in length. This doesn't solve our clip-path issue by itself. First we need to get this as a percentage of the whole length of the vertical side (9).

So, to work out the top angle, we need to divide this by 9 and multiply it by 100%:

````
tan(8deg) * 16 / 9 * 100%
````

For the bottom angle, we need to reverse it by taking it away from 100%:
````
100% - (tan(8deg) * 16 / 9 * 100%)
````

Unfortunately CSS (or any of it's preprocessors?) don't have native trigonometry functions. However, someone already made them! Take a look at the post [Trigonometry in Sass](https://unindented.org/articles/trigonometry-in-sass/). By adding these functions into our code, we can then use the functions in our SCSS. Here's our final clip-path for our 16x9 image:

````SCSS
clip-path: polygon(0 #{tan(8deg) * 16 / 9 * 100%}, 100% 0, 100% #{100% - (tan(8deg) * 16 / 9 * 100%)}, 0 100%);
````

And here is a Codepen showing the same applied to 16:9, 4:3 and 3:4 aspect ratio images (I'm using [Intrinsic Ratios/Uncle Dave's Ole Padded Box](https://daverupert.com/2012/04/uncle-daves-ol-padded-box/) to maintain the images' aspect ratio):

<div class="flex-media flex-media-16x9">

Hope that didn't fry your brain like it did mine.
