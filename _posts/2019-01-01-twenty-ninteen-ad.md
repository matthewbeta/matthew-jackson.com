I'm not usually into the idea of New Year === fresh start. Its just an arbitrary date in the cosmic scheme of things. However, this year feels
necessarily different. 

2018 was a tough one for me. There are some particular reasons for that and some less easy to put my finger on. Regardless, I am pretty pleased 2018 ended when it did (and good riddance). 

I feel like 2019 will be a more positive year. I don't do resolutions as that’s an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself. That said, there are definitely things I want to do differently this year. I want to affect my year as much as I can by changing a few habits of my own. To help me I've decided to publish an unordered lists of those things.

* Be. More. Positive
* See more live art and comedy
* Go on more dates with SH
* Be more understanding of things that irritate me (that includes myself)
* Exercise more
* Eat better and drink better
* Wear shirts
* Read more
* Write more
* Draw
* Be interested
* Focus on things that are in my ability to change or affect
* Worry less about things that I have no control over
* Chew gum
* Meditate if/when I feel like
* Play more
* Get regular haircuts

Hopefully next year’s list will be shorter.
