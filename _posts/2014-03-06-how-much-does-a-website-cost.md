<p class="lede">If you ask me, I'm gonna ask how much you got. I am aware that makes me sound like a jerk. Or a con artist. Let me explain why it makes sense for both of us.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">My partner and I are currently trying to buy a house (I know. Pretty cool). Now there are <a href="http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-42913942.html">houses</a> and there are <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_vqBNElQIYfE/TFYH3TnutrI/AAAAAAAAAEI/gdBnjQmWmwA/s1600/twistershithouse.jpg">houses</a>. One of the first questions the Estate Agent will ask is always "what's your budget?" </p>

An estate agent needs to know how much I have so we don't waste each others time either looking at stuff I can't afford or places I don't wanna live. 

A website is a lot like a house. It can be big. Or small. Complicated or easy to build. Have lots of features or hardly any. It has running and upkeep costs… You get the idea. 

I have a figure in my head of £250 to £300 per day when I look at a project. How many days it takes me are dependent on a lot of things, as explained above. Is that amount negotiable? Everything is negotiable. 

Building a website or app is a 2 way thing. Both you and I are gonna dance. What you initally wanted might not be possible for your budget. But we can work out a solution to your problem that is within your budget (probably) and build the best website you can afford.

So… what do you wanna make and how much you got?
