<p class="lede">I was completing the Collect part of Tesco's Click &amp; Collect offering t'other day. That's pretty fucking interesting of itself (thanks) but not the reason I'm dribbling words out of my fingers</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The shopping is stored in a little hut, exiled from the main store on the other side of the car park. The hut is manned (as far as I can tell) in turns by two gentlemen, both very nice and a credit to their organisation. I know them, affectionately, as Man-1 and Man-2.</p>

On this occasion Man-1 greeted me. As usual we passed the awkward time of me unloading the crates into my bags-fo-life with general waffle about traffic and weather. He asked what I did for a living and I said, Web design and development.

Man-2 reckoned to have clocked me for a designer. Probably the beard. Man-2 said used to work in design. University educated and all. Man-2 said he found it all a bit cut throat. Didn't really get on with it. Eventually gave up and and retrained.

I explained how I'd found the profession to be the complete opposite. Very open. Very friendly. He then caved and said he just used to find chasing clients for money too stressful. He left it saying now he just designs for himself, for fun.
