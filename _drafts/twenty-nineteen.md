I'm not reall yinto the idea of New Year = fresh start. Its just an arbitrary date in the cosmic schme of things. However, I sort of feel different this year. 2018 was a tough one for me. Some particular reasons for that and some less easy to put my finger on. Suffice to say, I am pretty pleased 2018 ended when it did and good riddance to it. I feel like 2019 can be a bit more positive. 

Anyways, I don't do resolutions as thats a dumb pressure to put on yourself. There are definitely things I want to do differently this year. To help me I've decided to publish an unordered lists of those things.

* Be. More. Positive
* See more live stuff
* Go on more dates with SH
* Be more understanding of things that irritate me
* Exercise more
* Eat better and drink better
* Wear shirts
* Read more
* Write more
* Draw
* Be interested
* Focus on things that are in my ability to change or affect
* Worry less about things that I have no control over
* Chew gum
* Meditate when I feel like
* Play more
* Get regular haircuts
