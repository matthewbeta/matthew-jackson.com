		<p>Hi. My name is Matt and I make websites. That means I talk to people to understand their goals, their users' needs and thinking. I plan ongoing digital and content strategies. I work with designers to integrate brands into digital experiences and products. I also do a bit of coding.</p>

		<p>You can <a href="/blog">read my (infrequent) blog</a> posts. I don't tweet much these days, but you can <a href="/thoughts">read my stream of consciousness</a>. I also post some <a href="/photos">photos</a> from time to time. You can see what I do by visiting <a href="//bluegg.co.uk">the best design agency in Wales</a>.</p>
